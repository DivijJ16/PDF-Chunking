# PDF-Chunking
This project features a robust model designed to extract crucial data from any PDF document, whether it contains text, images, or both. The model segments PDFs into meaningful chunks, processes them intelligently, and delivers highly relevant insights—structured and ready for downstream applications like summarization, indexing, or information retrieval.

📚 Use Cases:
🔍 Academic & Research Papers
Extract key takeaways from dense scientific literature.
Generate structured summaries of each section or chapter.
Identify important visuals (charts, graphs, illustrations) alongside their contextual text.

🏢 Corporate & Financial Reports
Automatically extract financial highlights, trends, and risk factors from annual reports.
Capture visual data (tables, charts) with explanatory notes.
Enable fast search and retrieval of important business sections.

⚖️ Legal & Policy Documents
Extract clauses, terms, and referenced visuals from lengthy contracts or regulatory PDFs.
Detect section-wise insights and obligations for review.

📊 Product Manuals & Technical Guides
Break down technical instructions and illustrations.
Summarize operational steps, warnings, and diagrams with relevant details.


🧩 How It Works
Preprocessing: The PDF is split into manageable chunks (3 pages).

Image + Text Analysis:
Text is extracted and interpreted using NLP techniques.
Images are processed for captions, charts, or embedded data.

Insight Extraction:
Each chunk is analyzed for key messages and context.
A global document context is maintained to enhance chunk-level insights.

Output Generation:
JSON format containing paragraph-wise insights.
Separate JSON with concise summaries for each chunk.
